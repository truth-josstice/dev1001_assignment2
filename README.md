| **Blackjack Simulator**               | There are multiple control flows and loops used to parse and create data, enabling the player to experience a simulation of gameplay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Menu-Driven Interface**             | Simple CLI terminal menu to navigate game modes, view stats, and exit the game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **House & Gameplay Rules**            | In-app access to 'House Rules' and 'Gameplay Rules' for new players to understand how the app's Blackjack version works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Multiple Table Types**              | Four types of tables to choose to play from which include: Low Rollers (200), Mid Rollers (500), High Rollers (1000) and No Limit tables. Each table adopts different rulesets and bet limits and have specific amounts of chips to be won.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Gameplay Flow**                     | he game features multiple control flow structures to handle player bet amounts and game outcomes. Tables load with default chip pools. Players place chip bets, play hands against a dealer AI and their stats are updated after each round.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Dealer AI Logic**                   | A basic AI logic is implemented for the dealer, allowing the dealer to make decisions (eg. hit/stand) based on simplified rules. At the end of each round, player and table stats are updated and saved to relevant JSON stat files. These stats track chip counts, wins and losses for player's progress across sessions.                                                                                      |
| **Custom ASCII Card Display**         | layer and dealer cards are visualised using a custom ASCII card function, displaying them side-by-side in the terminal. Hands are generated and calculated using CSV files for card values and suits, ensuring fair and dynamic gameplay visuals.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Player Statistics Tracking**        | Tracks player's current chip count, total chips won and lost, total hands played and lost Stats persist between sessions via JSON files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Progress Saving & File Loading**    | Player and table stats data is either initialised through a new game, or loaded from JSON files to continue and save progress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Data Management**                   | Player profiles and table statistics are saved in JSON files. These persist between sessions and can be updated after each play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Data Privacy by Design**            | No sensitive user data is collected or shared. All game data is stored locally with [manual deletion instructions provided here](./USAGE_INSTRUCTIONS.md#data-management-and-privacy).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Error Handling and Critical Files** | Custom error-handling methods have been built into the application to manage common user input errors and prevent crashes. While most scenarios are accounted for, some key combinations or edge cases may still trigger Python-native exceptions. Essential file `newtables_DONOTDELETE.json` is required for proper game functionality as it loads the predefined stats for each of the four types of tables. |

## Ethical Considerations

<!-- IMPORTANT TO NOTE FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT:
"Developers working on gambling simulations bear ethical responsibilities to minimise harm, comply with relevant laws, protect user data, and promote fair, transparent play. Referencing regulatory and academic guidance is essential to ensure that such projects do not inadvertently contribute to gambling-related harms or regulatory breaches." -->

As a developer of a simulated gambling application, I recognise the ethical responsibilities involved in minimising harm, promoting fair play and ensuring legal compliance. While this project is a non-commercial, educational simulation with no real money involved, future developments aim to align with responsible design principles and industry ethical standards to ensure best practices are followed.

Two globally recognised professional codes of ethics that guide responsible computing practices are:

1. [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)
2. [IEEE Code of Ethics](https://www.computer.org/education/code-of-ethics)

Both codes remind developers that their work should benefit society, avoid causing harm and create systems that are fair, honest and support the wellbeing of users.

**1. Responsible Design and Prevention of Harm**

- **Minimise Risk of Addiction (ACM 1.2 - Avoid Harm):**

  - Features that mimic addictive mechanics (eg. reward loops, rapid replay cycles, scoreboards) have been consciously avoided.
  - The current implementation uses a slow print integration to slow down gameplay, reducing the chance of rapid, compulsive replays.
  - Future updates may explore limit-of-play features to further minimise and discourage excessive gameplay sessions.

- **Transparent Communication (ACM 1.3 - Be Honest and Trustworthy):**
  - This readme document clearly communicates to users that the application is a simulation for educational and entertainment purposes and does not involve real money transactions or financial loss or gain.
  - Transparency is maintained to avoid misleading representations that could contribute to risky behaviours.

<!-- Research source: Simulated gambling environments can normalise betting behavior and increase the risk of problem gambling, even when no real money is involved. -->

**2. Legal and Regulatory Compliance**

- **Age Restrictions (ACM 1.2 - Avoid Harm / IEEE #5 - Improve Understanding of Technology):**
  - Future development will incorporate age verification systems to comply with legal requirements (eg. Australian Interactive Gambling Act) ensuring underage users cannot access gambling simulations.

<!-- Research source: Compliance with Local Laws:
Ensure the game does not violate online gambling regulations, such as those outlined in the Australian Interactive Gambling Act. Even simulated gambling may fall under regulatory scrutiny if it promotes betting or could be mistaken for real gambling.-->

**3. Data Privacy and Player Protection**

- **User Data Security (ACM 1.6 - Respect Privacy / IEEE #1 - Disclose Personal Gain Interests):**
  - Personal data is not collected or shared and no sensitive information to users are stored or collected.
  - User's player profile data files are stored locally on the user's device in the project's file `playerstats.json` with clear instructions for manual deletion [here](./USAGE_INSTRUCTIONS.md#data-management-and-privacy).
  - Any future implementation of user's player profiles will ensure robust authentication and encryption measures.

<!-- Research source: Applications should responsibly handle any personal or gameplay data, ensuring privacy and security. Persistent storage of statistics or profiles should not expose sensitive information. -->

**3.Promotion of Fair Play**

- **Algorithmic Fairness (ACM 1.4 - Be Fair and Take Action Not to Discriminate):**
  - The card dealing logic uses a genuine randomisation algorithm to ensure outcomes are unbiased and not rigged to favour the house.

<!-- Can probably consider including a documented logic (like flowshare) to show how functions use randomisation/ai to support fairness in gameplay. -->

<!-- Research source: Disclosure of Odds and Rules: Game rules, odds, and payout structures must be accessible and understandable to all users. Hidden mechanics or unclear rules undermine informed user choice. -->

**4. Social and Psychological Impact**

- **Mental Health Awareness (ACM 1.2 - Avoid Harm / IEEE #8 - Treat Fairly All Persons):**
  - While this application is not intended to be widely distributed or open-source, I acknowledge the potential influence of simulated gambling environments on user behaviour and mental wellbeing.
  - Recognising that simulated gambling environments can shape attitudes towards real gambling, the app promotes responsible engagement and provides resources for mental health and gambling support.
  - I encourage all users to engage responsibly and be mindful of the psychological impacts associated with gambling related activities (even in a simulated context).
