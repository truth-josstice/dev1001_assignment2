# Class and Function Usage

## Main Gameplay Loop

- `mainloop()` - Core game loop managing all gameplay flows and error handling.

  - Parameters:
    - None
  - Returns:

    - `None` (perpetual loop until exit)

  - Primary Workflow:

    1. `main_menu()` entry
    2. `choose_table()` selection
    3. `t_rules()` display
    4. Betting → Dealing → Player/Dealer turns
    5. `results()` evaluation
    6. Play-again prompt

  - Key Features:
    - Manages all object states, and local list management:
      - Chip tracking (`player_stats`)
      - Table bank monitoring
      - Bet list clearing
    - Visual polish:
      - `progbar()` loading indicators
      - Double `os.system("clear")` for flicker reduction
      - Consistent 2-second transitions
  - Error Handling:
    - `IndexError`: Corrupt data → `meme_error()`
    - `FileNotFoundError`: Missing saves → new player prompt
    - `KeyboardInterrupt`: Graceful exit options
    - `SystemExit`: Clean termination
    - Universal fallback error to catch unknown errors and return to game play loop via `main_menu()`
  - State Checks:
    - Table chip availability
    - Player chip balance
    - Play-again decisions

- `main()` - Calls mainloop to execute application when `run_blackjack.py` is executed in the terminal

## Imported Classes

`Deck` from `playingcards` package is a collection of cards that form a standard 52 card deck, in some cases this has been modified to 104 cards.

- Methods imported from Deck:
  - `shuffle()` - Shuffles the cards in the collection (via `random` standard module).
  - `draw_n(n)` - Draws a number of cards from the top of the deck.

`Card` from `playingcards` is a card object with params of suit, rank and value which assists with scoring and identification of card objects.

## Custom Classes

This app contains two custom classes, Table and Player, as well as the NoLimit Table subclass.

`Table` is a specific table with a finite amount of chips, minimum and maximum bet limits, and a transparent rule set based on specific blackjack standards.  
`Table` attributes:

```python
    # Class-level type annotations. Details what attributes the class has, and type of attribute.
    name: str  # Name of each table (e.g. High Stakes), used for display/tracking tables
    bank: int  # How many chips the dealer has
    max: int  # Maximum bet allowed, used to validate players bets
    min: int  # Minimum bet allowed, used to validate players bets
    r17: str  # Rule to decide dealer behavior upon drawing 17 (e.g Hit or Stand)
    deck: Deck  # Card Deck object created from playingcards Deck class
    player1: "Player"  # Player object created from Player class used for defining player data
    player: list[Card]  # Players current hand as a list of Card objects
    dealer: list[Card]  # Dealers current hand as a list of Card objects
```

`NoLimit` Table subclass attributes are the same as above, but have null values for params which are no longer applicable, as well as custom functions to account for these changes.

`Player` creates the player instance based on user input of name, with default values for starting amount of chips.  
`Player` attributes:

```python
    # Class-level type annotations. Details what attributes the class has, and type of attribute.
    name: str  # The player’s name, used for display/tracking player
    chips: int  # Current players chip total
    hands: int  # Total hands played by player
    wins: int  # Total hands won by player
    losses: int  # Total hands lost by player
    chip_won: int  # Total chips won by player
    chip_lost: int  # Total chips lost by player
```

### `Table` Class Methods
